# OutlierChecker

Information: This python script automates a portion of the data reviewing process as a data analyst intern at Integra Technologies. There are sample excel files and production excel files. Sample files have data that has been previously approved by the engineer whereas production files have data that is newly produced. This script is used to compare averages and standard deviations between sample files and production files. Sometimes there are a few columns of tests to compare which can be done by hand, sometimes there are a few hundred, and sometimes there are a few thousand. Each of these test columns have an average and standard deviation on a fixed row. 

Directions: The python script displays a dialog box for user to enter one or multiple sample files, then prompts another dialog box for user to enter one or multiple files. The script will create a "Final Review" excel sheet that reads the row of averages from each sample file and puts them vertically adjacent. Followed by this, the script will read the row of standard deviations from each sample file and puts them vertically adjacent. Once this is done, the same will be repeated for production files. After this, the excel file will have a block of sample averages, sample standard deviations, production averages, and production standard deviations. Script will graph these rows and place them into the excel file for user to analyze and interpret for anomalies.
